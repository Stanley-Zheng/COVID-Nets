## COVID-19 Diagnosis from Chest X-Rays using Neural Networks

Using various neural-networks to diagnose COVID-19 from posteroanterior chest x-rays and CT scans. 
Instructions to train and create a dataset can be seen [here](https://github.com/Stanley-Zheng/COVID-ResNet/blob/master/makedataset.md)

The main script to create the dataset is [`makedataset.py`](https://github.com/Stanley-Zheng/COVID-ResNet/blob/master/makedataset.py)
